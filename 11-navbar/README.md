## Navbar

> Burger menu button that toggles navbar.

NOTE: This project shows 3 different ways to toggle navbar.

First two were commented out with description.

Third way allows toggle navbar and what is important to calculate height for container with links thanks to useRef() and vanilla JS. Thus, we can add or remove links and container height will always match its content.
